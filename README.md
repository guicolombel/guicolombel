### Hi there 👀

I’m Guillaume Colombel, a 23yo freelance interactive developer based in paris, france. Autodidact developer, I studied design at school during 5 years in parallel to doing freelance work as a developer. To this day, I still design personal projects as well as the occasional client work. This background allows me to be very sensitive to design details, motion, typography !
